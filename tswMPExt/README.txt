tswMovePoint Extensions

This sub-project aims to let TSW itself to draw map damage overlay and connectivity highlights, based on the following considerations:
1. The GDI objects (such as DC, bitmap) are not shared across different processes (see this ref: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8699535), so tswKai3, as a separate process, cannot directly read the contents of TBitmap from the game process.
2. Within the TSW process, the timing of redraw can be better controlled.
3. For tswKai3.1.x, it is necessary to temporarily stop `TTSW10.Timer1` to avoid TSW's own redrawing procedure to overwrite our drawings. Also, on-map damage will only display when TAB is being pressed. 

Given the complexity and challenge of this goal, it has been achieved in 2 phases (For more details, see https://github.com/users/Z-H-Sun/projects/2?pane=issue&itemId=55496442):

- Phase 1: New feature updates are realized by C programming, and the dynamic patch of the TSW game is realized by DLL injection.
  - Achieved in 'dmg.dll.c' and 'dmg.exe.c'. They can be compiled into 'dmg.dll' and 'dmg.exe', respectively (see the source code files on the compilation commands). 'dmg.dll' should be placed in the same folder as 'TSW.exe'. After executing 'dmg.exe', which injects relevant codes into TSW process, one can press F1/F9 to start/stop showing on-map damage overlay.

- Phase 2: C codes are converted into lower-level assembly codes, which can be directly written into the memory of TSW game without the need of an additional DLL. In addition, the assembly codes are further optimized in order to fit into the limited memory size starting from address 0x4BA1B5 until 0x4BB000, so no additional virtual memory needs to be allocated.
  - IDA was used to disassemble the generated 'dmg.dll'. The assembly codes generated by `gcc` was used as a good reference, but they were extensively rewritten to adapt to TSW process and to remove redundancy (so the opcodes can fit into the limited vacant memory space). The assembly codes are available in '../tswMPExt_1.asm' (which serves to replace 'dmg.dll') and '../tswMPExt_2.asm' (similar to the asm codes in 'dmg.exe.c').
  - Achieved in 'tswMPExt_demo.c'. Once compiled, 'tswMPExt_demo.exe' can work on its own without the need of an additional DLL. Like 'dmg.exe', press F1/F9 to start/stop showing on-map damage overlay.

The success of this sub-project allows direct transfer of the achievements here to the tswKai3 project (see '../tswMPExt.rb').
